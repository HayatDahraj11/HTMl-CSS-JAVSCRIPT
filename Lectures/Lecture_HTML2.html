    <!-- CONCEPT 7: ORDERED LIST -->
    <!-- The <ol> element creates an ordered list with custom starting points. -->
    <ol type="1" start="13">
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>

        <i>heading</i> and paragraph &nbsp; are <mark>nested</mark> within the <body> element, they are visible on the web page.
        When an element is placed inside of another element, also known as nested, it is a good idea to indent that element to keep the document structure well organized and legible.
        <span>In the previous code,</span> both the <head> and <body> elements were nested and indented inside the <html> element. The pattern of indenting for elements continues as new elements are added inside the <head> and <body> elements.
